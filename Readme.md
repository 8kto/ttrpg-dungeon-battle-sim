A tool built super quickly for my fellow OSR players.
I sourced the equipment lists, along with their weights and costs, from the rulebook and used the **BFRPG Equipment Emporium** to fill in any missing weights.

Contributions are welcome!

## Disclaimer I

This is an unofficial tool for "Swords and Wizardry" and is not endorsed by the game's publishers.
All related trademarks belong to their respective owners.

## Disclaimer II

This is a quick and dirty code; I spent only a little time making it "clean". You can read the sources at your own risk.

To see a better approach I took on a similar project, check out my other TTRPG helper and [generator for the Lamentation of the Flame Princess](https://github.com/8kto/ttrpg-lotfp-helpers) system.

## Demo

## Features

- [x] Random character generation (basic, check TODO)
- [x] Lists of equipment, weapons, and armor with weight and cost
- [x] Inventory management, calculating total weight, cost, and speed
- [x] Multiple inventories that can be renamed. For example: "Zsusza, the thief", "Zoltan, the mercenary", "Solomon, the donkey", etc.
- [x] Quick equipment sets that can be selected to save time when generating a new character
- [x] Saves inventory in the browser's local storage, meaning the selected items will persist after a page reload
- [x] Displays help on encumbrance and speed
- [x] Converts text (which can be copied from other sources) into equipment and adds it to the inventory
- [x] Exports inventories as JSON, which can be manually added to the browser's storage (dev tools). I didnâ€™t have time yet to write a more convenient import feature.
- [x] Custom items
- [x] Builds with WMR
