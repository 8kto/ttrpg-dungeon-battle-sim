A tool built super quickly for my fellow OSR players.
I sourced the equipment lists, along with their weights and costs, from the rulebook and used the **BFRPG Equipment Emporium** to fill in any missing weights.

Contributions are welcome!

- [x] Quick equipment sets that can be selected to save time when generating a new character
- [x] Saves inventory in the browser's local storage, meaning the selected items will persist after a page reload
- [x] Displays help on encumbrance and speed
- [x] Converts text (which can be copied from other sources) into equipment and adds it to the inventory
- [x] Exports inventories as JSON, which can be manually added to the browser's storage (dev tools). I didnâ€™t have time yet to write a more convenient import feature.
