## Overview

Battle Simulator models engagements between two groups:

- Players & Henchmen (optional)
- Monsters

Each combatant can be defined by:

- Attack Bonus (to-hit)
- Hit Dice
- Damage: one or more attacks, e.g. `d6, d8+1`

Two modes of simulation are available:

- **Average**: uses expected values for hit points and damage
- **Random**: rolls dice for each attack and hit-point roll

## Features
